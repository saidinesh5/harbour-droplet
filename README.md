Droplet browser is a lightweight browser for Sailfish OS, that lets you multitask seamlessly as your webpage loads.

You can continue scrolling through your events feed or chatting away in your chat app, while it fetches your requested websites in the background. No more switching/peeking back and forth between the browser and your requested app, until the website is ready.

This is not a replacement, but a complementary addition to the Sailfish Browser. (That's why the feature "Double tap to open in Sailfish Browser"!)

### Features
- Handles Downloads via. Sailfish Browser
- Bookmarks and History
- Tap a link to load it in the background using Droplet browser. Double tap a link to let Sailfish Browser handle it.


### Note
You need to first install and enable https://github.com/saidinesh5/sailfishos-lipstick-enable-applets either via. Patchmanager or Patchmanager 2.0 for the browser to work correctly.
Why is the Lipstick patch needed? Without it, the app cannot grab keyboard input. It also shows up on your lock screen (The last place you want your browser to be!). While the app can still run in the "Fallback mode" without it, it will nag you with a notification!
